‚úÖ**Project Summary**

This project, conducted in Python, focuses on analyzing customer reviews for the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, and Toyota Corolla from 2009. The goal is to determine which car has the highest customer satisfaction rate among the three and to investigate whether the satisfaction rate for the Honda Accord has improved from 2008 to 2009. Additionally, the project aims to categorize the customer reviews for the Honda Accord from 2008 into meaningful groups using clustering techniques.

‚úÖ**ETL Focus:**

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for this project involves extracting the data from the provided datasets (2009_honda_accord, 2009_hyundai_sonata, 2009_toyota_corolla, 2008_honda_accord), cleaning the data by removing numbers, HTML tags, and using lemmatization, and then loading the cleaned data into a format suitable for analysis.

üë®‚Äçüíª**Skills Developed:**

-Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation techniques using Python

-Text preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python

-Sentiment analysis for determining customer satisfaction rates using the TextBlob library in Python

-Clustering techniques for grouping customer reviews using the scikit-learn library in Python

-Data visualization using word clouds with the WordCloud library in Python

‚úÖ**Conclusion**

By analyzing the customer reviews, we can determine which car model achieved the highest customer satisfaction rate among the three. Additionally, we can assess whether the satisfaction rate for the Honda Accord improved from 2008 to 2009. The clustering of the Honda Accord reviews from 2008 into meaningful groups will provide further insights into customer sentiments and preferences.
Overall, this project offers valuable insights into customer perceptions of these car models, which can be used by the companies to improve their products and services.
